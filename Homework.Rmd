#### ***Homework 1*: Due Tuesday, September 6th**

1) (1.2)
2) (1.5 Give reason for your answer)
3) (1.12)


4) A regression model is $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$. There are six observations. The summary statistics are:

$$\sum y_i = 8.5,\quad \sum x_i = 6,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 16,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 15.5,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 17.25$$
Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$

5) You are fitting a linear regression model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$ to 18 observations. You are given the followings:

$$\sum y_i = 252,\quad \sum x_i = 216,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 3092,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 3364,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 4528$$
Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$

6) You are fitting a linear regression model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$ to the following data:


| x | 2 | 5 | 8 | 11| 13| 15| 16| 18|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| y | -10 | -9 | -4 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8|





Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$ using $R$

7) Given the following information 

$$\sum y_i = 1742,\quad \sum x_i = 144,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 2300,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 26696,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 312674 \quad n = 12$$
Determine the LS equation for the model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$.

#### ***Homework 3*: Due Thursday, September 22nd**

You are turning in two files. 1. Hand written work. 2. A pdf created by Rmarkdown for the problems where it says "Use R to check your answers".

1) *5.1*  (Show work by hand calculations. Use R to check your answers)
2) *5.3*  (Hand calculations only)
3) *5.4*  (Show work by hand calculations. Use R to check your answers)
4) *5.6*  (Show work by hand calculations. Use R to check your answers)
5) *5.10* (Hand calculations are fine but using R would be easier. I will accept the answer either way)
6) *5.12* (Hand calculations are fine but using R would be easier. I will accept the answer either way)
7) *5.14* (Hand calculations are fine but using R would be easier. I will accept the answer either way)
