#### ***Homework 1*: Due Thursday, August 26th**

1) (1.2)
2) (1.5 Give reason for your answer)
3) (1.12)


4) A regression model is $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$. There are six observations. The summary statistics are:

$$\sum y_i = 8.5,\quad \sum x_i = 6,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 16,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 15.5,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 17.25$$
Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$

5) You are fitting a linear regression model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$ to 18 observations. You are given the followings:

$$\sum y_i = 252,\quad \sum x_i = 216,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 3092,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 3364,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 4528$$
Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$

6) You are fitting a linear regression model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$ to the following data:


| x   | 2   | 5   | 8   | 11  | 13  | 15  | 16  | 18  |
| y | -10 | -9 | -4 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 |





Calculate the LS estimate of $\beta_1$ using $R$

7) Given the following information 

$$\sum y_i = 1742,\quad \sum x_i = 144,\quad \sum x_i^2 = 2300,\quad \sum x_iy_i = 26696,\quad \sum y_i^2 = 312674 \quad n = 12$$
Determine the LS equation for the model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$.
