Prerequisite: MAT 2240 and either STT 3820 or STT 3850.

**Course Description:**  

An introduction to least squares estimation for both simple and multiple regression models. Linear algebra is used to represent both regression models and estimated parameters. Considerable attention is given to the analysis of variance, aptness of the model tests, residual
analysis, the effects of multicollinearity, and variable selection procedures. Logistic regression, Poisson regression, and Generalized Linear Models are also introduced. Theoretical results will be explored with a comprehensive and up to date statistical programming language.
